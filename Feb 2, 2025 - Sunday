Problem 1: Find the Single Non-Duplicate Element
Given a sorted list of integers where every element appears twice except for one element that appears once, find the single element that does not have a duplicate.

def single_non_duplicate(nums):
    for num in nums:
        if nums.count(num) == 1:
            return num

Problem 2: Rotate an Array
Given a list of integers and an integer k, rotate the list to the right by k steps.

def rotate_array(nums, k):
    nums[:] = nums[-k:] + nums[:-k]

    return nums

Problem 3: Find the Longest Consecutive Sequence
Given a list of unsorted numbers, find the length of the longest consecutive sequence (e.g., [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2] contains [1, 2, 3, 4], which has a length of 4).
