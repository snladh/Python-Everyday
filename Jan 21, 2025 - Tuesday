Question 1: Reverse Words in a String
Write a function reverse_words(s) that takes a string s as input and returns the string with the order of words reversed. Words are separated by spaces.

def reverse_words(s):
    splitted = s.split(" ")
    reversed = splitted[::-1]
    return " ".join(reversed)
# join function works only for the string.



Question 2: Find All Duplicates in a List
Write a function find_duplicates(nums) that takes a list of integers nums and returns a list of all duplicate numbers. Ensure each duplicate appears only once in the result.

def find_duplicates(nums):
    unique = set()
    dup_list = set()
    for i in nums:
        if i in unique:
            dup_list.add(i)
        else:
            unique.add(i)
    return list(dup_list)
