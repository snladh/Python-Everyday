Question 1: Factorial of a Number
Write a function factorial(n) that takes an integer n and returns the factorial of n (denoted as 𝑛 ! n!). The factorial of a non-negative number 𝑛 n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to 𝑛 n.

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    product = n
    while n != 1:
        product *= (n-1)
        n -= 1
    return product

Question 2: Remove Duplicates From a List
Write a function remove_duplicates(nums) that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with duplicate elements removed, preserving the order of their first occurrence.

def remove_duplicates(nums):
    unique = []
    seen = set()
    for a in nums:
        if a not in seen:
            unique.append(a)
            seen.add(a)
    return unique



Question 3: Find the Longest Word in a Sentence
Write a function longest_word(sentence) that takes a string sentence and returns the longest word in the sentence. If there are multiple words with the same length, return the first one.
