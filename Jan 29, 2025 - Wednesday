Problem 1: Find the Missing Number in an Array
Given a list of n-1 integers in the range 1 to n, with no duplicates except for one missing number, write a function to find the missing number.

def find_missing_number(nums, n):
    sum_t = n*(n+1)/2
    sum_m = sum(nums)
    return sum_t - sum_m


Problem 2: Check if Two Strings are Anagrams
Write a function that takes in two strings and checks if they are anagrams (i.e., both strings contain the same characters in the same frequency but in any order).

def are_anagrams(str1, str2):
    sorted_1 = sorted(str1)
    sorted_2 = sorted(str2)
    return sorted_1 == sorted_2

Problem 3: First Non-Repeating Character
Given a string, find the first non-repeating character and return it. If all characters are repeating, return None.
