Question 1: Check for Palindrome
Write a function is_palindrome(s) that takes a string s and returns True if the string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward), ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters, and False otherwise.

def is_palindrome(s):
    cleaned_str = ""
    if s.isalnum():
        cleaned_str += s.lower()
    return cleaned_str == cleaned_str[::-1]

Question 2: Find the Intersection of Two Lists
Write a function list_intersection(list1, list2) that takes two lists of integers as input and returns a new list containing elements that are present in both lists. Ensure there are no duplicates in the output.



Question 3: Sort a Dictionary by Value
Write a function sort_dict_by_value(d) that takes a dictionary d as input and returns a new dictionary sorted by its values in ascending order. The keys should remain paired with their corresponding values.
